1. What is the difference between a class and an interface in object-oriented programming?When would you use
   an interface instead of a class? Can a class implement multiple interfaces? If so, how would you do this?
-->
                    Class                                           interface
     a. It is a blueprint for creating objects.         a. It is a blueprint of the class.
     b. It can be instantiated i.e create a object.     b. It can't be instantiated
     c. It can have its own implementation of methods   c. It only defines a set of methods and properties that
        and properties                                     must be implemented by any class that implements the
                                                           interface
     d. It's field can be of any type.                  d. It's fields are static, public, and final by default
                                                           and methods are public and abstract.

--> We can use interface when you want to define a set of methods and properties that must be implemented by
    multiple classes.

--> Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces.
--> We can do this by implementing multiple interfaces and separating them with commas in the class declaration.
    For example:
        public class Dog{
            void bark();
        }
        public class Lion{
            void roar();
        }
        public class Demo implements Dog,Lion{
            public void bark(){
                System.out.println("Dog is barking");
            }
            public void roar(){
                System.out.println("Lion is roaring");
            }
            public static void main(String args[]){
                Demo boj=new Demo();
                obj.bark();
                obj.roar();
            }
        }

2.
a. What is collection framework? What is an Iterator in Java, and how is it used? The purpose of hasNext() and
   next()?
--> Collection framework in java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group
    of objects.

--> An Iterator in java is an object that enables you to traverse or loop through a collection of objects,
    such as an ArrayList or a HashSet, one element at a time.
    To use an iterator, you first need to obtain an instance of the Iterator interface for the collection you
    want to iterate over. You can do this by calling the iterator() method on the collection object.
    For example:
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
        // Add some elements to the list...
        Iterator<String> itr = list.iterator();

--> The purpose of hasNext() is to return true if the iterator has more elements to traverse otherwise false.
    The purpose of next() is to return the next element in the collection and advances the iterator.

b. What is the time complexity of adding, removing, and searching for an element in an Array, Linked List,
   Stack, and Queue?
-->
    a. Array
        Adding at the end: O(1)
        Adding at a specific index: O(n)
        Removing at the end: O(1)
        Removing at a specific index: O(n)
        Searching for an element: O(n)

    b. LinkedList
        Adding at the beginning: O(1)
        Adding at the end: O(1)
        Adding at a specific index: O(n)
        Removing at the beginning: O(1)
        Removing at the end: O(1)
        Removing at a specific index: O(n)
        Searching for an element: O(n)

    c. Stack
        Adding an element (push): O(1)
        Removing the top element (pop): O(1)
        Accessing the top element: O(1)

    d. Queue
        Adding an element (enqueue): O(1)
        Removing the first element (dequeue): O(1)
        Accessing the first element: O(1)

c. What is the List interface in Java, and what are some common implementations of it?
--> List interface is the child interface of Collection interface that inhibits a list type data structure in
    which we can store the ordered collection of objects with duplicates allowed.

--> Some of the common implementations of it are:
    a. ArrayList
        The ArrayList class implements the List interface and uses a dynamic array to store the duplicate element
        of different data types. It maintains the insertion order and is non-synchronized. The elements stored
        in the ArrayList class can be randomly accessed.

    b. LinkedList
        LinkedList implements the Collection interface and uses a doubly linked list internally to store the
        elements. It can store the duplicate elements. It maintains the insertion order and is not synchronized.
        In LinkedList, the manipulation is fast because no shifting is required.

    c. Vector
        Vector uses a dynamic array to store the data elements. It is similar to ArrayList. However, It is
        synchronized and contains many methods that are not the part of Collection framework.

    d. Stack
        The stack is the subclass of Vector. It implements the last-in-first-out data structure, i.e., Stack.
        The stack contains all of the methods of Vector class and also provides its methods like boolean push(),
        boolean peek(), boolean push(object o), which defines its properties.


d. What is the difference between a List and a Set in Java?
-->
                List                                                    Set
     a. It can contains duplicate elements.            a. It can contains only unique elements.
     b. It maintains the order of the elements as      b. It does not guarantee any particular order.
        they are added to the list
     c. It allows elements to be accessed using an     c. It doesn't allows elements to be accessed using an
        index.                                            index.
     d. Adding, removing, and accessing elements in    d. Adding, removing, and accessing elements in a Set is
        a list is slower.                                 faster.
     e. It uses an array or linked list to store its   e. It uses hashing to store its elements.
        elements.
     f. It is implemented by ArrayList, LinkedList,    f. It is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet and treeSet.
        Vector and Stack.
