Thread: Flow of Execution or Independent part of the Program.
MultiThreading
Concept of executing the multiple independent parts of the program simultanesouly.
Advantages
*To increase Performance
*To reduce ideal time of CPU.
*To reduce the response time of CPU.

Application of Multitasking
*To develop multimedia graphics
*To develop Animation
*To develop WebServer and Application Server

Ways to define thread in Java
*By using Runnable Interface
*By using Thread Class.

JVM is reponsible to schedule the thread to schedule the task of the thread.
So Exact Order of output is not possible and it is varied from JVM To JVM.
No guarantee of Exact Output but we can provide several possible output.

If we use run method directly without using start method while running the thread
then it will invoke method same as normal method and run the program like normal without
creating separate thread so we need to use the start method to run the thread so it will be
treated as thread.


Start Method of the thread Class.
start(){
1.Register this thread with thread Scheduler
2.Perform all other mandatory activities
3.Invoke run().
}

start method is the heart of the Multithreading because it perform all the registering , scheduling and
other mandatory activities.


Overloading of the run method is possible but start method will automatically invoke the run
method with no-args run method.

It is not recommened to overwrite start method because it will be invoke like normal method and not separate
thread will be created.

If thread is already started and again next time we try to restart the thread then we will ge the RE: Illegal Thread
StateException.
