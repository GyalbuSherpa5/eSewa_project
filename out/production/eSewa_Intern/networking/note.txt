Networking
Concept of connecting two or more computing devices together so that we can share resources.

Advantages
*Sharing Resources
*Centralize Software Management

Java.net package supports two protocols
*TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)
Reliabe Communication between sender and receiver because connection oriented.

*UDP(UserDatagram Protocol)
Connection-less protocol service by allowing packet of data to be transfered along two or more nodes.

Network Terminology
1.IP Address
2.Protocol(Set of rules basically followed for communication)
3.Port Number(Used to uniquely identify different applications. communication endpoints)
4.MAC Address (Media Access Control) unique identifier Of NIC(Network Interface Controller).
5.Connection-oriented and Connection-less protocol
Connection-Oriented(Acknowledgement is sent by the receiver after receiving so reliable but slow in perfromance.)
ConnectionLess Protocol(Acknowledgement is not sent by the reciever but relaibe but fast.)
6.Socket(Endpoint between two way communications)

java.net package
It can be divided into two sections
1.Low-Level API
Deals with the abstractions of addresses i.e networking identifers, Sockets i.e bidirectional data communication mechanism
and Interfaces ile network interfaces

2.High Level API
Deals with the abstraction of URLs(Universal Resource Identifiers , URLS (Universal Resource Locator and Connections)
to the resource pointed by URLS.

List of the classes provided by the URLS
*Authenticator
*CacheRequest
*CacheResponse
*ContentHandler
*CookieHandler
*DatagramSocket
*DatagramSocketImpl
*InterfaceAddress
*JarURLConnection
*MulticastSocket
*InetSocketAddress
*InetAddress
*Inet4Address
*IDN
*HttpURLConnection
*HttpCookie

Java Socket Programming
Used for communication between the applications running on different JRE.

It can be both connection-oriented or Connection-less

Socket and ServerSocket  classes are used for connection oriented socket Programming
DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket classes are used for connection-less socket Programming

Client must Have:
1.Ip Address of Server
2.Port Number

Socket Class
simply and endpoint for communications between the machines.

Important Methods
//return the InputStream attached with this socket.
public InputStream getInputStream()
/returns the OutputStream attached with this socket.
public OutputStream getOutputStream()
public synchronized void close() //closes this socket.


ServerSocket
ServerSocket class can be used to create a server socket.
Object is used to establish communciation with the clients.

Important Methods
public Socket accept()//return the socket and establish a connection between server an
public synchronized void close // closes the server socket.
